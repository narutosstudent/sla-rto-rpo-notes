# RTO - Recovery Time Objective

- **What it is**: RTO refers to the maximum amount of time that a system or application can be down after a failure or disaster before the business is significantly affected.
- **Simple Explanation**: Think of RTO as the "deadline" for fixing a system after it goes down. For instance, if a company has an RTO of 4 hours, it means they need to get their system back up and running within 4 hours of an outage to avoid major business impact.
- **Why it's important**: Setting an RTO helps businesses plan their disaster recovery strategies and prioritize which systems need to be restored first.

# RPO - Recovery Point Objective:

- **What it is**: RPO refers to the maximum amount of data loss that's tolerable during a disaster or outage. It's defined by the age of the files that must be recovered from backup storage for normal operations to resume.
- **Simple Explanation**: RPO is about how much recent data you can afford to lose when there's a system failure. For example, if a business has an RPO of 1 hour, it means they can tolerate losing 1 hour's worth of data in the event of a failure.
- **Why it's important**: RPO helps in determining the frequency of data backups. A lower RPO means more frequent backups are needed.

# SLA - Service Level Agreement:

- **What it is**: An SLA is a formal document that defines the level of service expected by a customer from a service provider. It outlines metrics like uptime, performance, and responsibilities of each party.
- **Simple Explanation**: SLAs are like promises made by a service provider to their customers about the quality and availability of their services. For example, an SLA might guarantee 99.9% uptime for a web hosting service.
- **Why it's important**: SLAs set expectations for service delivery and provide remedies or penalties if the service levels are not met. They are crucial for maintaining trust and accountability between service providers and clients.
